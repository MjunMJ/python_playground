A randomly constructed sentence however, has each character randomly picked, so each character has equal chance of appearing.\n",
        "*   Hamming distance: Similar to the above, the hamming distance of a different parts of a readable sentence *should* be less than that of a randomly generated sentence. It doesn't seem to always happen in my random trials, and also as this blogger shares [here](https://trustedsignal.blogspot.com/2015/06/xord-play-normalized-hamming-distance.html), but it's a signal nonetheless.
